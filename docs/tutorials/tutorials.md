# Notebooks, Tutorials, Scripts and Notes

The tutorials are a markdown copy of the original Jupyter notebooks, which can be found 
[here](https://github.com/deepdoctection/notebooks).

Deep dive tutorials offer a look behind the scenes to **deep**doctection and cover topics like architecture and 
configuration. 

The scripts contain code snippets that set out configurations and hyperparameter settings for training or contain
evaluation scripts that can be used to understand benchmarks.

In the notes you will find some further questions about certain models. In contrast to the scripts, model variants that
require additional implementation are examined for example.
