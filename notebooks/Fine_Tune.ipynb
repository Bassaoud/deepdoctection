    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "We show how a model can be fine-tuned for a specific task and how the performance can be compared with the pre-trained model.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this purpose, we want to try to improve the table extraction in the **deep**doctection analyzer as an example. To better understand what we are trying to address, we need to say a little more about processing table extraction.\n",

    "Table extraction is carried out in different stages:\n",

    "- Table detection\n",
    "- Cell detection\n",
    "- Row and column detection\n",
    "- Segmentation / cell labeling\n",
    "\n",
    "Tables, cells and rows / columns are recognized with object detectors (Cascade-RCNN with FPN).\n",
    "The segmentation is carried out by determining the coverage of cells to rows and columns and is rule-based.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cell recognition was carried out on the [**PubTabNet**](https://github.com/ibm-aur-nlp/PubTabNet) dataset. PubTabNet contains approx. 500K tables from the field of medical research.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to fine-tune cell recognition on a dataset that comes from a completely different domain, namely financial reports. For this we use [**FinTabNet**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.00589.pdf), a data set that contains around 100K tables from that domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to fine-tune on your own data set, you should create your one dataset instance based on the example of the existing datasets. We use a DatasetRegistry to be able to access the dataset directly. Before we start fine tuning, let's take a look at the dataset. It will show you the advantage of the concept within this framework and how it easily integrates into the training scripts."

       "'FinTabNet dataset contains complex tables from the annual reports of S&P 500 companies with detailed table structure annotations to help train and test structure recognition. To generate the cell structure labels, one uses token matching between the PDF and HTML version of each article from public records and filings. Financial tables often have diverse styles when compared to ones in scientific and government documents, with fewer graphical lines and larger gaps within each table and more colour variations. Fintabnet can be used for training cell detection models as well as for semantic table understanding algorithms. For detection it has cell bounding box annotations as well as precisely described table semantics like row - and column numbers and row and col spans. The dataflow builder can also return captions of bounding boxes of rows and columns. Moreover, various filter conditions on the table structure are available: maximum cell numbers, maximal row and column numbers and their minimum equivalents can be used as filter condition. Header information of cells are not available. As work around you can artificially add header sub-category to every first row cell. All later row cells will receive a no header  sub-category. Note, that this assumption will generate noise.'"

We set the learning rate to be .001 which is quite common for fine tuning this model. We set the schedule to have 50K iterations and set a random resizing of the train dataset between 600 and 1.2K pixels.\n",
    "- The other settings affect the dataset dataflow build config. As already mentioned we need to crop tables from the images. As we crop them at the beginning, we have to store these images in memory. This is not ideal but peculiar for this dataset and requires either a large memory or a small training dataset. We choose 15k samples. As we only use parts of the images this might ok, but you can set this setting lower if you RAM is not that large.  "
